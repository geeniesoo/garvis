My key features:
• Intelligent task routing to specialized agents
• Natural language processing for user requests
• Slack integration with mentions, DMs, and slash commands
• Modular architecture for easy extension

How can I help you today?`;

*Direct Questions:*
• "What is [topic]?" - Get information about a topic

• "Tell me about [subject]" - Learn about subjects

*Available Agents:*
• Info Retrieval (me) - Questions and information
• Task Manager - Todo lists and reminders
• Code Helper - Programming assistance

*Commands:*
• Type "help" for full agent capabilities
• Type "status" for system information

What would you like to know more about?`;

However, I'm currently running in demonstration mode with limited knowledge access. In a full implementation, I would:

• Search relevant databases and APIs
• Access real-time information sources  
• Provide detailed, accurate answers
• Offer related topics and follow-up questions

For now, I can help you with:
• General questions about Garvis
• Current time and date
• System status and capabilities
• Routing to other specialized agents

Is there a specific aspect you'd like to explore, or would you like me to connect you with another agent?`;
